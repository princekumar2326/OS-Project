AI-Disk Scheduling Algorithms
👉Project Overview

The AI-Disk Scheduling Algorithms project is an intelligent, web-based simulation system designed to analyze and visualize disk scheduling techniques used in modern operating systems.
This project integrates algorithmic logic with AI-inspired decision analysis to help understand how dynamic request handling can improve disk performance.

Unlike traditional static explanations, this system provides interactive simulations, enabling users to observe disk head movement and analyze performance metrics such as seek time and efficiency.
