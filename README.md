AI-Disk Scheduling Algorithms
👉Project Overview

The AI-Disk Scheduling Algorithms project is an intelligent, web-based simulation system designed to analyze and visualize disk scheduling techniques used in modern operating systems.
This project integrates algorithmic logic with AI-inspired decision analysis to help understand how dynamic request handling can improve disk performance.

Unlike traditional static explanations, this system provides interactive simulations, enabling users to observe disk head movement and analyze performance metrics such as seek time and efficiency.

👉AI Concept Used in the Project

Although classic disk scheduling algorithms are rule-based, this project applies Artificial Intelligence principles such as:

Intelligent decision making based on current disk head position

Predictive behavior analysis of incoming disk requests

Performance optimization through comparative evaluation

Adaptive visualization to help users understand optimal scheduling patterns

The project simulates how AI systems can assist operating systems in choosing the most efficient scheduling strategy under varying workloads.

✨👉Algorithms Implemented

The following disk scheduling algorithms are implemented and analyzed:

FCFS (First Come First Serve) – baseline algorithm for comparison

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) – AI-inspired nearest-request selection

SCAN – directional intelligent disk movement

C-SCAN – circular optimization approach

LOOK – AI-optimized scanning without unnecessary traversal

C-LOOK – enhanced LOOK with reduced seek overhead

Each algorithm is visualized to demonstrate intelligent disk head movement and request servicing.
